//Q1 pattern code
n = 5

for i in range(1, n + 1):

    print(' ' * (n - i) +  '*' * i)

Q2:-create a program that prompts the user to input two numbers and perform division .handle the airthmeticexception that might occur if 
the user attempt to divide the zero and any potential numberformatexception that migth occur during the conversion.in such cases
infrom the users about the error and ask for input again.

            num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
            num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
            result = num1 / num2
            print(f"The result of {num1} divided by {num2} is {result:.2f}")
